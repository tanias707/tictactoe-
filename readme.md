# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe in C++

A clean, minimal, and fully functional **two-player terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game**, written in pure C++. Built from scratch to demonstrate strong command over basic algorithms, condition handling, and clean code practices.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ 2-player turn-based gameplay (X vs O)
- 🧠 Smart logic to check win/draw conditions
- 🛠️ Easy-to-read code and modular functions
- 💻 Console-based interface (runs on any OS)
- 🎯 Beginner-friendly project structure

## 📸 Game Preview

```text
Player 1 (X)  -  Player 2 (O)

     |     |     
  X  |  O  |  X  
_____|_____|_____
     |     |     
  O  |  O  |  X  
_____|_____|_____
     |     |     
  X  |     |  O  
     |     |     

==> Player 2 wins!
## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

- Use of functions and control structures  
- Array-based board representation  
- Input validation and turn management  
- Game condition checking (win, draw)

---

## Future Improvements

- Single-player mode with basic AI (minimax algorithm)  
- Color-coded board for better user experience  
- GUI version using SFML or Qt  
- Score tracking and save history

## Why This Project?

Built as part of my journey to master C++ fundamentals and improve logic-building.  
A small game — big learning.
